Functional Properties

Functional properties of food are what a food is made up of, and how it can be used to make something else. Below are the defined properties.

Proteins have bonds of twenty-two ‘building blocks’ called amino acids that have their own purposes. The amino acids that make up a protein can be combined into different ways to make many other proteins; thousands more, that is.

Amino acids can be arranged in different ways that make how a food is made, i.e. fish have a different arrangement of amino acids than chicken or bread. In detail the arrangement of the acids determines the protein’s use therefore food, which come down to two different types of protein that’ll be explained later. Before that, individual amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains, much like a single strand of beads. Each strand either coils back or makes a spring shape because of how an amino acid is attracted to another, which is usually hydrogen atoms being attracted to one another, or with sulphur. It is these arrangements that create the two proteins, fibrous and globular. Globular proteins are rounded and have a compact shape, these are found in eggs, milk and its derivatives, and enzymes. Enzymes are found in the cells of all living things and are responsible for ripening fruit, and when fruit goes brown when cut (see Enzymatic Browning).

Fibrous proteins are coiled into a helix to make a strand; they are found in muscle fibres of fish, chicken and meat, and also found in products made from flour that contain gluten. 

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, and it gives flour products their structure. Gluten has two proteins that make itself up, glutenin and gliadin.

Carbohydrates have three types of components: polysaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides.

Monosaccharides are single-sugar molecules. They can either be glucose, fructose or galactose. These make up all carbohydrates in food.

Disaccharides are two-sugar molecules. There are three different types, which are made from the mentioned monosaccharides. These are sucrose, which is a bonded form of glucose and fructose; Lactose, which is a bonded glucose molecule and galactose molecule; and maltose, which are two glucose molecules bonded together.

Polysaccharides are three-sugar molecules that are monosaccharides chained together. There are three different types; glycogen, pectin and starch.

Starch is found in grains such as rice and wheat, and in vegetables such as potatoes and cassava, and the size of the starch can vary on the type of food it comes from. There are two components that make up a starch molecule: amylose and amylopectin. These come in the ratio 1:4 for amylose respectively, however can be modified in corn to be 1:2 or even over that. If a food had more amylose than amylopectin, then that food would have different qualities than that of a food with more amylopectin. As an example, foods with more amylose produce semi-solid, opaque gels and vice versa for amylopectin [14].

Enzymatic Browning – are caused by polyphenol oxidase, catechol oxidase and other enzymes to create a chemical reaction that causes a browning pigment in fruits and vegetables; such as bananas, mushrooms and crabs [1][2].

This process can either be good or bad depending on what food item is being browned; such that is bad for fruit, like apples after being cut, and also for seafood. An example of beneficial browning is tea, which enhances flavour, and also raisins, which enhances flavour and also colour [2]. 

Dextrinization – is the browning of starch when exposed to dry heat. The starch within that food goes through a chemical reaction that breaks molecules down into dextrin. This turns the food product into a brown or yellow colour. An example of such is bread when being toasted, or cake [3].

Effects of dextrinization could be a change of colour, taste, or aroma [4].

Caramelization – A non-enzymatic browning reaction that uses water and sugar. Sugar is broken down and oxidised during the process, while water evaporates. Both these processes give out chemical reactions that create the distinctive caramel flavour [5], which is used in various sweet treats such as cola, toffee or even as a sauce that can alone be eaten with many other foods.

Crystallization – is a formation of crystals that have formed from sugar cooling. In further detail, this happens when two separate substances separate from each other or when a liquid changes to a solid [4]. This is used with various sweet treats such as toffee [6]. 

Denaturation – is when a protein changes their shape because of a breakdown of bonds between amino acids, this can occur due to heat, which is one of the processes that happens to an egg while cooking [7]. After this, Coagulation takes over; making the previous example (an egg) have its whites turn more into a solid, and also opaque. This is used in the making of meringues, where when being beaten caused denaturation and coagulation occurs because of heat [4].

Emulsification – Oil and water don’t blend well without assistance. Emulsification is beating two substances together (i.e. fat/oil and water) for a long amount of time until everything is dispersed well [4]. A use of emulsification is used with mayonnaise, where oil is needed to be blended with other ingredients [8].

Gelatinisation – When heated starch granules become placed in cold water, a gel is created because of the swelling and thickening of the starch. Eventually the cellulose wall of the starch is ruptured due to granules bumping into each other, water is also absorbed [4]. Gelatinisation can be exemplified with lemon meringue pie filling.

Gelation – The cooling process in the creation of a gel; where cooler temperatures make it set [12] to a certain point where it becomes syrupy and eventually a thick. There is no specific set time for a gel to set, but there are variables that affect the duration of being exposed to cold to setting, such as the amount of gel (smaller proportions are quicker to thicken), time, temperature, concentration etc. Gelation is important in the creation of jelly, which is responsible for solidifying it in the fridge [13].

Aeration – is combining two ingredients together (one being sugar) to make the food behave differently depending on its properties, specifically lighter due to air being put into the ingredients because of sugar being cut through the other ingredient. This process is called Mechanical Leavening; taken as an example, using sugar and a liquid, like eggwhite, can create a foam that is used for creating meringues [9].

Chemical Leavening – This type of leavening involves using compounds, such as baking soda that produce carbon dioxide that assists in raising certain ingredients such as dough while they are being baked [10]. Baking soda reacts with any acids that it is in contact with (lemon juice, buttermilk i.e.) that causes the mentioned carbon dioxide to create air pockets to make the food rise. Chemical leavening is predominant for baked foods, such as cakes or cookies, which help them rise [11].

Biological Leavening – uses living organisms to assist with raising foods. Baker’s Yeast is a fungus that eats the glucose contained within the dough and excreting their waste, which can be carbon dioxide. This type of leavening is used in wine making, or in the production of bread.

In preparation of the lemon meringue pies we need to ensure that we take safe care throughout its preparation so that we don’t cause illness or harm.

Without this care, there is an increased risk of food-borne illnesses if the pies were consumed due to bacteria; or harm to self during preparation.

How do we keep safe? Easy. Just be sure to take these precautions:

1. Handle food safely. This will decrease the chances microbial activity on the foods you process. The term of handling food safely differs to what food/ingredient you are handling; taken in this case, all ingredients we using in the making of the lemon meringue pies. Be sure to follow the recipe as directed, store food appropriately and properly, and also prevent cross contamination of different types of food.

2. Prevent micro-organisms. This applies to all food, and not just the lemon meringue pie. To do this, we ourselves must be sure to wash our hands, which are a place that organisms can grow. Washing hands will kill bacteria we come across. Another thing is to be sure that all utensils and serving ware we use are clean before and after using them, so that there aren’t micro-organisms on those mentioned [14].
